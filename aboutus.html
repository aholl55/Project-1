<h1>ABOUT US!</h1>
<p>My name is Anna Holley and as a first time mom, going to college full-time and working part-time as a waitress, I always struggled with mom guilt, especially when it comes to the food my daughter eats.  That is why me and my partner started "The Baby Bakery" to help the group of young parents who alsoo struggle finding healthy and tasty options for their babies to also enjoy sweets without exposure to any harmful ingredients.  We also have readily avalible many links to helpful sources for baby-led weaning, dinner ideas for multiples, smash cake recipes, etc.  Thank you for chosing The Baby Bakery!</p>
